### I have never heard about Tunnll before

Yes, we are not widely known yet. In short, the team at [Tunnll](http://tunnll.com) is small, international and is obsessed with advanced technologies. We develop and run smart transportation systems for urban transport.

### Why you should join 

[We are](/) a team with a flat organizational structure with each team member [doing tasks](http://tunnll.com) he or she really enjoys doing. Please, check out the [Job openings](/jobs/) page to know more about how our team works.


### Terms and conditions:

*   There is no compensation for the internship.
*   All the activities during the internship are regulated by an internship agreement which should be signed before the internship starts.
*   Although Tunnll is very small, some of references that we provided to our former interns have helped them to land jobs in large well-known companies.
*   Our formal headquarters are in Spain (with business operations in Sweden and the UK), but the team members live and work remotely from different parts of the world (Sweden, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Russia, India, etc.)
*   This internship is 100% remote. It means that as an intern you would have to work alone in front of your computer. Some people do not like when there are no opportunities to socialize in the office and therefore we usually recommend candidates to [consider the remote factor thoroughly](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Remote-Required-David-Heinemeier-Hansson/dp/0091954673/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457969776&sr=8-1&keywords=remote+book){:target="_blank"} before applying.
*   Since the internship is remote, the working hours are very flexible. The main requirement are the daily reports which should be done daily. If we do not receive a daily report from an intern during the internship, the internship is automatically terminated on the same day (the internship is not added to the CV, no recommendation letter is provided).
*   The internship is built around testing the self-learning skills of the intern, as well as his/her ability to be a reliable part of the team. Therefore, the internship is essentially a course of studies during which the intern reads relevant sources, applies new knowledge to complete assignments and does reporting about that.
*   The internship is done in 2 phases. During the 1st phase the intern studies himself/herself; the assignments start with very simple ones, but the difficulty increases closer to the end of the 1st phase. If the 1st phase is completed sucessfully the intern joins the team to study/work on more difficult assignments with the help of team members (company chat, online portal, Skype). During both phases the intern also studies by a curated reading list to widen his/her theoretical knowledge.
*   The first phase of the internship can take about 2 weeks and the second phase can take about 8-10 weeks.
*   The internship requires the intern to study 3-5 hours daily, 5 days a week. However, if an intern wishes to study on a faster pace, he/she can be transfered to the 2nd phase earlier.
*   (if you are located in Sweden) Up to ~5000 SEK monthly internship payment paid by one of [Arbetsförmedlingen's](http://www.arbetsformedlingen.se/){:target="_blank"} support programs Arbetspraktik, Jobb- och utvecklingsgarantin, Jobbgarantin för ungdomar or by the Praktikplats program of Arbetsmarknadsenheten in your town.
*   OR no compensation if Arbetsförmedlingen or an Arbetsmarknadsenheten does not grant you any financial support;
*   Depending on the intern's performance, the intern might be proposed a [full-time position](/jobs/) relevant to his area of expertise at the end of the internship period.

### Whom we expect to see in the team

We prefer to enhance our team with [generalists](http://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/specialist-generalist-what-do-employers-want){:target="_blank"}, because they tend to perform more efficiently compared to specialist in ever-changing situations. That means that it is absolutely ok if you lack some specific skills in your CV, but it also means that the range of the tasks assigned to you will be very broad.
