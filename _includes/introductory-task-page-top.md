# How this introductory task is organized

## Introductory task structure

The introductory task consists of two parts: 

1. Part One. A simple task that can be completed remotely.
2. Part Two. A more advanced task that you will be asked to complete in one of our offices. 

If you complete the Part One successfully (deliverable quality and respect to deadlines), we will be glad to invite you to visit one of our offices and to complete Part Two on-site. In case of successfull completion of the Part Two, we will be glad to have an interview with you.

## General rules

1. The working and communication language of this introductory task is English (including the interview), if not specified otherwise.

2. The internship process is very well documented. Please, make sure that you have read this document thoroughly (including all the links, footnotes and references) before sending any questions to hello@tunnll.com.

3. When we talk about deadlines, a “week” means a calendar week, i.e. 7 calendar days.

4. Each task employs a set of custom-tailored reading sources that will help you to complete the task. If a reading source (article, book, link, blog post, etc.) contains some practical exercises, all of them should be completed and saved to your personal Dropbox folder (or Github account) before completing the actual task.

5. Please, create an empty folder with any cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) and an empty GitHub repository (for software engineers only).

6. You should save all deliverables (files, documents, images, etc.) to your cloud file storage folder (or to Github in case of code).

7. If you think you need help, do as follows:

  - Carefully re-read the task description, make sure you have understood the task correctly.
  - If the previous step does not help, copy the text you are not sure about (Error text for software engineers, definitions for all the others) and try to perform a problem research with Google/DuckDuckGo. 
  - If the previous step does not help, create a detailed question in regards to your problem and post it on a respective site of the StackExchange network (some useful sites are Software Engineering, Graphic Design, UX, Startups (business-related), English Language and Usage and Writers among others). Your question should contain links to resources that you have found during your problem research.
  - If the previous step does not help, send your question to hello@tunnll.com including the word “Question” in the subject. Your email should include a link to your question on the StackExchange network. Ambiguous questions like “It does not work” or “I do not know how to do that” will remain unanswered.
