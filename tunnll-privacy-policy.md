# Tunnll – Privacy Policy

## Scope;

Tunnll (“Tunnll,” “we,” “our,” and/or “us”) values the privacy of individuals who use our application, websites, and related services (collectively, the “Tunnll Services”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information from Tunnll users (“Users”), and Tunnll passengers (“Passengers”). Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of Tunnll is also subject to our Terms of Service.

## Information we collect when you use our website;

- Email. When you subscribe to Tunnll’s newsletter, you give us your email address. 
- Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies. We collect information through the use of “cookies” and similar technologies to understand how you navigate through the Tunnll’s website, to learn what content is popular, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use the Tunnll’s website. You should consult your web browser(s) to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may be missing out on certain Tunnll features.
- Communications. If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you. For example, when you contact our Customer Support Team, we will receive your name, email address, phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.

## Information we collect when you use our application;

- User Profile Information. When you register with Tunnll, you can create a user profile. Filling out a profile is optional, and you can share as little or as much as you want. Some of the information you can opt-in to fill as part of your user profile includes user-profile-information.
- Payment Method. When you add a credit card or payment method to your Tunnll account, a third party that handles payments for us will receive your card information. To keep your financial data secure, we do not store any credit card information on our servers.
- Location Information. When you open Tunnll on your mobile device, we receive your location. We may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. Your location information is necessary for some of Tunnll’s features like directions to meeting points or to your destination or to determine what’s the right bus for you.
- Contacts. If you permit Tunnll to access your Social Media profiles, we may access and store names and contact information from your contact list to facilitate invitations and social interactions that you initiate through our Platform and for other purposes described in this privacy policy or at he time of consent or collection.

## Information we collect from third parties;

- Third Party Services. If you choose to register for Tunnll or otherwise link your Tunnll account with a third party’s service (such as Facebook), we may receive the same type of information we collect from you (described above) directly from those services.
- Third Party Partners. We may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, payment information, or fraud detection information, from third party partners and combine it with other information that we have about you.

## How we use the information we collect;

We use the information we collect from all Users to:
•	Connect Passengers with Buses;
•	Provide, improve, expand, and promote Tunnll Services;
•	Analyze how the Tunnll users use Tunnll Services;
•	Communicate with you, either directly or through one of our partners, including for marketing and promotional purposes;
•	Personalize the Tunnll experience for you, your friends and contacts;
•	Send you text messages and push notifications;
•	Facilitate transactions and payments;
•	Provide you with customer support;
•	Find and prevent fraud; and
•	Respond to trust and safety issues that may arise, including auto incidents, disputes between Passengers and Buses or Drivers, and requests from government authorities.

## How we share the information we collect;

- Sharing between Passengers and Buses. Buses and Passengers that have been matched are able to see bus information, such location or other ways to identify (like bus ID or license plate). Although we help Passengers reach their bus safely and efficiently, Tunnll does not share any private information from Passengers like your phone number or other contact information with the drivers. 
- API and Integration Partners. If you connect to Tunnll Services through an integration with a third party service, we may share information about your use of Tunnll Services with that third party. We may share your information with our third party partners in order to receive additional information about you. We may also share your information with third party partners to create offers that may be of interest to you.
- Third Party Services. Tunnll Services may allow you to connect with other websites, products, or services that we don’t have control over. If you use these services, we will provide the third party with information about you to allow them to provide the service to you. We can’t speak to the privacy practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies before deciding whether to use their services.
- Other Sharing. We may share your information with third parties in the following cases:
•	While negotiating or in relation to a change of corporate control such as a restructuring, merger or sale of our assets;
•	If a government authority requests information and we think disclosure is required or appropriate in order to comply with laws, regulations, or a legal process;
•	With law enforcement officials, government authorities, or third parties if we think doing so is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Tunnll Passengers, Tunnll, or the public;
•	To comply with a legal requirement or process, including but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures.
•	With our insurance partners to help determine and provide relevant coverage in the event of an incident;
•	To provide information about the use of Tunnll Services to potential business partners in aggregated or de-identified form that can’t reasonably be used to identify you; and
•	Whenever you consent to the sharing.

## Sharing & Subscription Options;

- Email Subscriptions. You can always unsubscribe from our commercial or promotional emails but we will still send you transactional and relational emails about your account use of Tunnll Services.
- Push Notifications. We will send you push notifications to facilitate your use of the Tunnll service: when it’s time to walk to the meeting point, when it’s time to board the bus, when it’s time to disembark the bus.
- Profile Information. You can delete any optional information that you added to your Profile at any time.
- Location Information. While you can prevent your device from sharing location information at any time through your Device’s operating system settings, without it we can’t provide our services to you.
- Facebook Friends. You can control the extent to which you use and share Tunnll Services through social media platforms, specifically Facebook.
- Editing and Accessing Your Information. You can review and edit certain account information by logging in to your account settings and profile.

## Other;

- Data Security. We are committed to protecting the data of Tunnll Passengers. Even though we take reasonable precautions to protect your data, no security measures can be 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your data.
- Children’s Privacy. Tunnll is not directed to children, and we don’t knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we find out that a child under 13 has given us personal information, we will take steps to delete that information. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 has given us personal information, please contact us through our Customer Support.
- Changes to Our Privacy Policy. We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes, we will let you know through Tunnll’s blog, by email, or other communication. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy periodically to stay up-to-date about our privacy practices. As long as you use Tunnll Services, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and any updates we make to it.
- Contact Information. Feel free to contact us at any time with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, our use and sharing practices, your consent choices or Tunnll Services by contacting our Customer Support.
